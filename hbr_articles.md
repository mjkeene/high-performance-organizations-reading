<h3>Rebounding from Career Setbacks</h3>
<i>by Mitchell Lee Marks, Philip Mirvis, and Ron Ashkenas</i>

`Key point: Take responsibility for your failures/shortcomings. Reframe losses as opportunities by learning from them.
Become excited about new possibilities rather than dwelling on negative emotions.`

<b>Note that this article affirms the recommendations in the book "Never Search Alone".</b>

* Even a dramatic career failure can become a springboard to success if you respond in the right way.
	* Determine why you lost
	* Identify new paths
	* Seize the right opportunity when it's within your reach


* People who were fired, laid off, or passed over for promotion often worked through the classic stages of loss: shock
and denial about the events, then anger at the company or boss, bargaining over their fate, and then a protracted period
of licking their wounds. <b>Many of them never make it to the "acceptance" stage.</b>


* High achievers usually take too much credit for their successes and assign too much external blame for their failures.
This protects self-esteem but also prevents learning and growth.
* People focus on situational factors or company politics instead of examining their own role in the problem.


* Most do not ask for candid feedback; they turn to sympathetic friends, family, or colleagues, who reinforce their self-image (e.g., "you deserved that job/promotion"; "you have every right to be angry") and feed their sense of injustice. <b>This prevents them from considering their own culpability and breaking free of the destructive behavior that derailed them in the first place.</b>


* Those who rebound from career setbacks take a very different approach. They actively explore how they contributed to
what went wrong, whether they judged a situation appropriately and reacted appropriately, and <b>consider what they
would do differently if given the chance.</b>
	* They also gather feedback from a variety of people (supervisors, peers, subordinates) -- this makes it clear 
      that they want <i>honest feedback</i>, and not consolation.


<u>Identifying New Paths</u>
* Turn your loss into a win; reframing losses as opportunities involves hard thinking about who you are and what you want.
* Escapism is a common reaction to career derailment -- people take trips, immerse themselves in busywork, drink or eat
excessively, or avoid discussing their thoughts and plans with family and friends. These activities give you space, but
rarely lead to a productive transition. 
	* It's more effective to engage in a focused exploration of all the options available.


* The status-quo has been disrupted, and it's not clear what success will look like in the future -- you're in a
"twilight zone". Pausing a bit can allow you to find new meaning in your setback.


<b>Note that this is very similar to what the book "Never Search Alone" recommends doing</b>
* Speaking to others to gain their perspective and advice on your goals can be very useful. One person mentioned
developed "four themes for my next job". She then tailored her job search to achieve those goals.


* Remember that you still have your skills and experience from your last job, they were not left behind. You also bring
with you the lessons learned from the setback. <b>You may also have productively revised your definition of success.</b>
	* Research has shown that needs and priorities can change dramatically over time -- major life milestones (e.g.,
  moving out for the first time, divorce, death in the family, etc.) are common examples of this happening.


* All of the people mentioned who turned their failure into a success did serious discovery work after the setback --
<i>and then acted with conviction</i>. 
* Note that it is possible to stay with a current employer and drastically change your mind-set or psychological
commitment. Shifting perspective like this takes just as much energy as switching companies or jobs.


* Resilience and adaptability don't come easily or naturally to everyone; the approach laid out here can help transform
the anger and self-doubt associated with failure into excitement about new possibilities.

<h3>Nine Things Successful People Do Differently</h3>
<i>by Heidi Grant</i>

`Key point: It's not who/what you are that makes you successful or not; it's what you do.`

* Why do we reach some goals but not others?

1. <b>Get Specific</b>: don't have vague goals (e.g., "lose weight"). If you instead said "lose 5lbs", then you know what
success looks like. Other specific actions could be "be in bed by 10pm on week-nights" rather than "sleep more". You
unambiguously know if you have done these things.
2. <b>Seize the moment to act on your goals</b>: It's easy to let time slip away; decide <i>when and where</i> you 
will take action, ideally in advance. "On Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I'll go for a 30-minute walk in the morning."
3. <b>Know exactly how far you have left to go</b>: Monitor progress honestly and regularly. Adjust behavior as necessary.
4. <b>Be a realistic optimist</b>: Be positive, but don't underestimate difficulties in achieving goals. Goals worth achieving
typically require time, planning, effort, and persistence. If you think it'll be easy and effortless, you're far more
likely to give up and fail.
5. <b>Focus on getting better rather than being good</b>: You <i>can</i> change and learn new skills. Believing in your ability
to reach your goals is important, but so is believing you can <i>get</i> the ability. Many people believe that intelligence,
personality, and abilities are fixed -- but they are not.
6. <b>Have grit</b>: Grit is a willingness to commit to long-term goals and to persist in the face of difficulty.
People lacking in grit often believe that they just don't have the innate abilities successful people have -- but they are wrong.
Effort, planning, persistence, and good strategies are what it really takes to succeed.
7. <b>Build your willpower muscle</b>: Self-control is like a muscle; if it doesn't get much exercise, it is weak. If it has
regular workouts, then it gets stronger. Build willpower by doing things you'd rather not do. Do them, and don't give in to the
easy route. Have a plan to deal with troubles ("if I have a craving for a snack, I will eat one fresh piece of fruit").
8. <b>Don't tempt fate</b>: Willpower is limited, no matter how strong it is. Don't take on a bunch of challenging new tasks
all at once (e.g., quitting smoking and starting a strict diet at the same time). Don't go to a bar with buddies if you're trying
to avoid drinking.
9. <b>Focus on what you <i>will</i> do, not what you <i>won't</i> do</b>: Plan on how you will replace your bad habits with good ones,
rather than focusing only on the bad habits themselves. Suppression (e.g., "don't think about white bears") makes it even more active
in your mind. Constantly thinking of avoiding bad habits strengthens them rather than breaking them. What positive things will you do rather
than the negative things you'd like to replace? Think about those.

<h3>The Power of Small Wins</h3>
<i>by Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer</i>


`Key point: People are most satisfied with their jobs (and therefore most motivated) when those jobs give them the
opportunity to experience achievement.`


* Of all things that boost emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a work day, the single most important is making
progress in <i>meaningful</i> work. The more likely people experience that sense of progress, the more likely they are to be
creatively productive in the long-term.
* Everyday progress -- even a small win -- can make all the difference in how someone feels and performs
* In the realm of knowledge work, people are more creative when their inner work lives are positive -- when they feel happy,
are intrinsically motivated by the work itself, and have positive perceptions of their colleagues and the organization. 
* 95% of managers from a survey did not rank supporting progress as the number one way to elevate employee promotion,
but that is what the authors have found to be most important. The vast majority of managers ranked supporting progress
in dead last place among 5 choices (support progress, recognition, incentives, interpersonal support, and clear goals).
  * Recognition for good work was ranked first for motivating workers and making them happy.


* The most common event triggering a "best day" was any progress made in work by an individual or team. The most common
event triggering a "worst day" was a setback.
* Setbacks can lead a person to feel generally apathetic and disinclined to do the work at all


* <i>Perceptions</i> differed on progress days and setbacks days as well. On progress days, people perceived more positive
challenges in their work, and saw their teams as more mutually supportive and reported more positive interactions between 
the teams and their supervisors. On setback days, participants perceived both their teams and their supervisors as less
supportive.
  * (Note that these are just correlations, and do not prove causality); it likely goes both ways.
  * We're not sure if the inner work life changes are a result of progress and setbacks, or the other way around.


* We do know that more positive perceptions, a sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, happiness, and even elation
followed progress. Likewise, deteriorating perceptions, frustration, and sadness followed setbacks.


* <b>Wins do not have to be large to make a difference; many of the progress events the research participants reported
represented only minor steps forward, yet they often evoked outsize positive reactions.</b> 
  * Across all types of events the participants reported, a notable proportion (28%) of incidents that had a minor impact
  on the project had a major impact on people's feelings about it.


* Progress events that often go unnoticed are critical to the overall performance of organizations because inner work
life has such a potent effect on creativity and productivity, and because small and consistent steps forward by many people
can accumulate into excellent execution.
* The flip side of this is that small losses or setbacks can have an extremely negative effect on inner work life.
* <b>Negative events can have a more powerful impact than positive ones, so it is especially important for managers
to minimize daily hassles.</b>


* The work must be <i>meaningful</i> to you, otherwise it does not have the same impact.
* If tasks feel irrelevant, then even working hard to get things done can leave you feeling demotivated, devalued,
and frustrated.
* Managers can make sure that their employees know just how their work is contributing, and therefore why it is important.
  * <b>Work can be "stripped" of its meaning when:
  	1. employees' ideas are ignored, thus making that person feel like their contributions are not meaningful. 
    2. employees' sense of ownership in their work is destroyed by frequently and abruptly reassigning them to another project,
    and now they cannot see the other project through to the end.
    3. Managers send the message that the work employees are doing will never see the light of day
    4. Managers neglect to inform employees of unexpected changes in a customer's priorities.</b>


* Good managers act as a resource for employees; they do not <i>check up</i> like a micromanager, they <i>check 
  in</i> to see if they can offer help.


* The most important implication of the progress principle:
  * Managers who support people and their daily progress improve the inner work lives of their employees as well as 
    the organization's long-term performance.
  * The dark side: negative feedback loops. If managers fail to support progress and the people trying to make it, 
    inner work life suffers and so does performance. Degraded performance further undermines inner work life.


* Managers who show basic respect and consideration for employees can focus on supporting the work itself; they do 
  not need to worry about complicated incentive schemes or psychological manipulation to motivate employees.
* Effective managers set the positive feedback loop in motion. Focus on managing progress rather than the management 
  of people. 


* Managers who facilitate steady progress in meaningful work, make that progress salient to employees, and treat 
  employees well have the best chance of a high performance team. <b>Their superior work will contribute to 
  organizational success — and they will love their jobs.</b>
