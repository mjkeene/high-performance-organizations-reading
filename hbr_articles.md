<h3>Blue Ocean Strategy</h3>
<i>by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne</i>

`Key point: create uncontested market space (blue oceans) rather than competing in existing, highly competitve 
markets (red oceans).`


* This article opens up describing Cirque du Soleil, a growing circus company, within a larger industry that has 
  been on the 
  decline for decades.
  * They did so by creating uncontested market space that made the competition irrelevant, NOT by operating within 
    the confines of the existing industry or by stealing customers from competitors.
  * It pulled in a whole new group of customers who were traditionally non-customers of the industry. These 
    customers were adults and corporate clients who had turned to opera, theater, and ballet, and were prepared to 
    pay several times more than the price of a conventional circus ticket.

* The bigger idea here is that there are two distinct kinds of space in the business universe:


1. <b>Red oceans</b>
2. <b>Blue oceans</b>


* Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today—the known market space.
  * These oceans have well-defined and accepted industry boundaries; the competitive rules of the game are well 
    understood. Companies try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the 
    space gets more crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced.
    * Products turn into <b>commodities</b> and increasing competition turns the water bloody.
* Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today—the unknown market space, untainted by competition. 
  Demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid.
  * There are 2 ways to create blue oceans. Companies can give rise to completely new industries, like eBay did with 
    online auctions. In most cases, a blue ocean is created from within a red ocean by altering the boundaries of an 
    existing industry. This is what Cirque did by breaking through the boundary traditionally separating circus and 
    theater.

* The logic behind blue ocean strategy parts with traditional models focused on competing in existing market space. 


* Look back 100 years and ask yourself which industries known today were then unknown:
1. Automotive
2. Music recording
3. Aviation
4. Petrochemicals
5. Pharmaceuticals
6. Management Consulting

* Now think back 30 years with the same question:
1. Mutual funds
2. Mobile phones
3. E-commerce
4. Express package delivery
5. Snowboards

* Just 30 years ago, none of these industries existed in a meaningful way. Now they are ubiquitous.

* <b>Now think forward 20 years. How many industries that are unknown today will exist then? Put simply, there will 
  be many.</b>
  * Companies will continue to create new industries and re-create existing ones.

* As concrete evidence of this change, take a look at the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System), 
  which is updated every 5 years to reflect any changes. The next scheduled update is in 2027.

* Corporate strategy is heavily influenced by its roots in military strategy, which is in part why it has a dramatic 
  imbalance in favor of red oceans.
  * The language is heavily imbued with military references—chief executive "officers", "headquarters", "troops" on 
    the "front lines". Strategy is all about red ocean competition when described this way. It is about confronting 
    an opponent and driving him off a battlefield of limited territory. 
  * In contrast, blue ocean strategy is about creating new land, not dividing up existing land.
  * Red ocean strategy means accepting the key constraining factors of war—limited terrain and the need to beat an 
    enemy to succeed. It also means denying the distinctive strength of the business world—the capacity to create 
    new market space that is uncontested.

* Strategy is often intertwined with the language of competition: "competitive advantage". With this view, companies 
  are often driven to outperform rivals and capture greater shares of existing market space.
* A superior strategy is to find and develop markets where there is little or no competition—blue oceans.


* Cutting-edge technology is sometimes involved in the creation of blue oceans, but it is not a defining feature of 
  them. Underlying technology is often already in existence. Sometimes technology even needs to be simplified to 
  link technology with what buyers value.
* Incumbents often create blue oceans, and usually with their core businesses (AWS for example).

* The article explains blue ocean creation in 3 industries (automobiles, computers, and entertainment)
  * There are 3 questions asked for each example: new entrant or incumbent, driven by technology pioneering or value 
    pioneering, and was the industry attractive or unattractive at the time of creation?
* Blue oceans are right next to you in every industry.


* Company and industry are the wrong units of analysis for analyzing how and why blue oceans are created.
* There is no consistently excellent company—the same company can be brilliant at one time and completely wrong at 
  another.
* Every company rises and falls over time. Likewise, there is no perpetually excellent industry; relative 
  attractiveness is driven largely by the creation of blue oceans from within them.
* Large R&D budgets are not the key to creating new market space. The key is making the right strategic moves.
* The creation of blue oceans is a product of strategy and as such is very much a product of managerial action.


* There are several common characteristics across the strategic moves that create blue oceans.
  * Creators of blue oceans never use the competition as a benchmark. Instead, they make it irrelevant by creating a 
    leap in value for both buyers and the company itself.
  * Perhaps the most important feature of blue ocean strategy: rejecting the idea that a trade-off exists between 
    value and cost. According to this, companies can either create greater value for customers at a higher cost or 
    create reasonable value at a lower cost. In other words, strategy is essentially a choice between 
    differentiation and low cost. With blue oceans, however, the evidence shows that successful companies pursue 
    differentiation and low cost simultaneously.


* Going back to the Cirque circus example—rather than competing with other circus companies and paying more for a 
  slightly better lion tamer or better-known clown (which did not substantially rise revenues), they redefined the 
  problem to offer people the fun and thrill of the circus <i>and</i> the intellectual sophistication and artistic 
  richness of the theater. They also realized that the animal portion of the circus is quite costly, and many people 
  were concerned with the treatment of the animals and did not want to see them due to ethical concerns of 
  exhibiting them.
* Cirque was able to extract the important elements of the circus, and enhance others by adding the theater aspect. 
  They offer the best of both circus and theater. And by eliminating many of the most expensive elements of the 
  circus, it dramatically reduced the cost structure, achieving both differentiation and low cost.


* By driving down costs while simultaneously driving up value for customers, a company can achieve a leap in value 
  for both itself and its customers.
* <b>A rejection of the trade-off between low cost and differentiation implies a fundamental change in strategic 
  mindset</b>—the authors cannot emphasize enough how fundamental a shift this is. 


* The structuralist view (environmental determinism) vs. reconstructionist view:
  * The structuralist view states that companies and managers are largely at the mercy of economic forces greater 
    than themselves.
  * By contrast, blue ocean strategy is based on a worldview in which market boundaries and industries can be 
    reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. This is the reconstructionist view.


* The Cirque du Soleil founders clearly did not feel constrained to act within the confines of their industry.
* The magic of Cirque was created through a reconstruction of elements drawn from all of the alternatives (theater, 
  opera, ballet, circus, etc.)
  * This new blue ocean from within the red oceans of theater and circus has uncontested market space that doesn't 
    yet have a name.


* Barriers to imitation: companies that create blue oceans usually reap the benefits without credible challenges for 
  10 to 15 years, as was the case with Cirque du Soleil, Home Depot, FedEx, Southwest Airlines, CNN, and AWS.
  * Blue ocean strategy creates considerable economic and cognitive barriers to imitation.
  * Because blue ocean creators immediately attract customers in large volumes, they can generate scale economies 
    very rapidly, putting would-be imitators at an immediate and continuing cost disadvantage.
  * For example, the huge economies of scale in purchasing that WalMart enjoys have significantly discouraged other 
    companies from imitating its business model.
  * There are also network externalities: the large number of users on eBay makes it a more attractive auction site 
    for both sellers and buyers, giving users few incentives to go elsewhere.
  * Organization bureaucracy and politics can slow adopting new or changing existing processes


* Parallels of Ford Model T and Cirque du Soleil:
  * Auto industry was small and unattractive
  * More than 500 automakers turning out handmade luxury cars that were enormously unpopular except for with the very 
    rich
  * Anti-car activists tore up roads and vandalized cars
  * Ford created a car that addressed the main concerns: bad roads (especially in rain/snow or mud), expensive and 
    difficult repairs, and negative sentiment to the rich who owned cars.
  * Ford made the competition irrelevant. Ford built a car for everyday use—easy to use and fix, easy to learn how 
    to drive, doesn't get stuck easily. Ford compared to horse-drawn carriages as a price point rather than other 
    autos. 
    * <b>Ford converted buyers of horse-drawn carriages into car buyers by getting the price lower than that of a 
      horse-drawn carriage ($290 for the car, $400 for the horse), just as Cirque turned theatergoers into 
      circus goers.</b>
  * After around 15 years, the majority of American households had a car.
  * Ford offered the mass of buyers a leap in value, and it also achieved the lowest cost structure in the industry.
  * The highly standardized cars got rid of the customized manufacturing process with highly skilled labor, and the 
    assembly line allowed unskilled laborers to work quickly and efficiently on one simple task. This drastically 
    sped up the manufacturing process by 5x (21 days vs. 4 days), and eventually improved even further.


* Competing in red oceans dominates the field of strategy in theory and practice, even as businesses' need to create 
  blue oceans intensifies.
* Blue ocean strategists have always existed, but their strategies have been largely unconscious.

<h3>Rebounding from Career Setbacks</h3>
<i>by Mitchell Lee Marks, Philip Mirvis, and Ron Ashkenas</i>

`Key point: Take responsibility for your failures/shortcomings. Reframe losses as opportunities by learning from them.
Become excited about new possibilities rather than dwelling on negative emotions.`

<b>Note that this article affirms the recommendations in the book "Never Search Alone".</b>

* Even a dramatic career failure can become a springboard to success if you respond in the right way.
	* Determine why you lost
	* Identify new paths
	* Seize the right opportunity when it's within your reach


* People who were fired, laid off, or passed over for promotion often worked through the classic stages of loss: shock
and denial about the events, then anger at the company or boss, bargaining over their fate, and then a protracted period
of licking their wounds. <b>Many of them never make it to the "acceptance" stage.</b>


* High achievers usually take too much credit for their successes and assign too much external blame for their failures.
This protects self-esteem but also prevents learning and growth.
* People focus on situational factors or company politics instead of examining their own role in the problem.


* Most do not ask for candid feedback; they turn to sympathetic friends, family, or colleagues, who reinforce their self-image (e.g., "you deserved that job/promotion"; "you have every right to be angry") and feed their sense of injustice. <b>This prevents them from considering their own culpability and breaking free of the destructive behavior that derailed them in the first place.</b>


* Those who rebound from career setbacks take a very different approach. They actively explore how they contributed to
what went wrong, whether they judged a situation appropriately and reacted appropriately, and <b>consider what they
would do differently if given the chance.</b>
	* They also gather feedback from a variety of people (supervisors, peers, subordinates) -- this makes it clear 
      that they want <i>honest feedback</i>, and not consolation.


<u>Identifying New Paths</u>
* Turn your loss into a win; reframing losses as opportunities involves hard thinking about who you are and what you want.
* Escapism is a common reaction to career derailment -- people take trips, immerse themselves in busywork, drink or eat
excessively, or avoid discussing their thoughts and plans with family and friends. These activities give you space, but
rarely lead to a productive transition. 
	* It's more effective to engage in a focused exploration of all the options available.


* The status-quo has been disrupted, and it's not clear what success will look like in the future -- you're in a
"twilight zone". Pausing a bit can allow you to find new meaning in your setback.


<b>Note that this is very similar to what the book "Never Search Alone" recommends doing</b>
* Speaking to others to gain their perspective and advice on your goals can be very useful. One person mentioned
developed "four themes for my next job". She then tailored her job search to achieve those goals.


* Remember that you still have your skills and experience from your last job, they were not left behind. You also bring
with you the lessons learned from the setback. <b>You may also have productively revised your definition of success.</b>
	* Research has shown that needs and priorities can change dramatically over time -- major life milestones (e.g.,
  moving out for the first time, divorce, death in the family, etc.) are common examples of this happening.


* All of the people mentioned who turned their failure into a success did serious discovery work after the setback --
<i>and then acted with conviction</i>. 
* Note that it is possible to stay with a current employer and drastically change your mind-set or psychological
commitment. Shifting perspective like this takes just as much energy as switching companies or jobs.


* Resilience and adaptability don't come easily or naturally to everyone; the approach laid out here can help transform
the anger and self-doubt associated with failure into excitement about new possibilities.

<h3>Nine Things Successful People Do Differently</h3>
<i>by Heidi Grant</i>

`Key point: It's not who/what you are that makes you successful or not; it's what you do.`

* Why do we reach some goals but not others?

1. <b>Get Specific</b>: don't have vague goals (e.g., "lose weight"). If you instead said "lose 5lbs", then you know what
success looks like. Other specific actions could be "be in bed by 10pm on week-nights" rather than "sleep more". You
unambiguously know if you have done these things.
2. <b>Seize the moment to act on your goals</b>: It's easy to let time slip away; decide <i>when and where</i> you 
will take action, ideally in advance. "On Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I'll go for a 30-minute walk in the morning."
3. <b>Know exactly how far you have left to go</b>: Monitor progress honestly and regularly. Adjust behavior as necessary.
4. <b>Be a realistic optimist</b>: Be positive, but don't underestimate difficulties in achieving goals. Goals worth achieving
typically require time, planning, effort, and persistence. If you think it'll be easy and effortless, you're far more
likely to give up and fail.
5. <b>Focus on getting better rather than being good</b>: You <i>can</i> change and learn new skills. Believing in your ability
to reach your goals is important, but so is believing you can <i>get</i> the ability. Many people believe that intelligence,
personality, and abilities are fixed -- but they are not.
6. <b>Have grit</b>: Grit is a willingness to commit to long-term goals and to persist in the face of difficulty.
People lacking in grit often believe that they just don't have the innate abilities successful people have -- but they are wrong.
Effort, planning, persistence, and good strategies are what it really takes to succeed.
7. <b>Build your willpower muscle</b>: Self-control is like a muscle; if it doesn't get much exercise, it is weak. If it has
regular workouts, then it gets stronger. Build willpower by doing things you'd rather not do. Do them, and don't give in to the
easy route. Have a plan to deal with troubles ("if I have a craving for a snack, I will eat one fresh piece of fruit").
8. <b>Don't tempt fate</b>: Willpower is limited, no matter how strong it is. Don't take on a bunch of challenging new tasks
all at once (e.g., quitting smoking and starting a strict diet at the same time). Don't go to a bar with buddies if you're trying
to avoid drinking.
9. <b>Focus on what you <i>will</i> do, not what you <i>won't</i> do</b>: Plan on how you will replace your bad habits with good ones,
rather than focusing only on the bad habits themselves. Suppression (e.g., "don't think about white bears") makes it even more active
in your mind. Constantly thinking of avoiding bad habits strengthens them rather than breaking them. What positive things will you do rather
than the negative things you'd like to replace? Think about those.

<h3>The Power of Small Wins</h3>
<i>by Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer</i>


`Key point: People are most satisfied with their jobs (and therefore most motivated) when those jobs give them the
opportunity to experience achievement.`


* Of all things that boost emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a work day, the single most important is making
progress in <i>meaningful</i> work. The more likely people experience that sense of progress, the more likely they are to be
creatively productive in the long-term.
* Everyday progress -- even a small win -- can make all the difference in how someone feels and performs
* In the realm of knowledge work, people are more creative when their inner work lives are positive -- when they feel happy,
are intrinsically motivated by the work itself, and have positive perceptions of their colleagues and the organization. 
* 95% of managers from a survey did not rank supporting progress as the number one way to elevate employee promotion,
but that is what the authors have found to be most important. The vast majority of managers ranked supporting progress
in dead last place among 5 choices (support progress, recognition, incentives, interpersonal support, and clear goals).
  * Recognition for good work was ranked first for motivating workers and making them happy.


* The most common event triggering a "best day" was any progress made in work by an individual or team. The most common
event triggering a "worst day" was a setback.
* Setbacks can lead a person to feel generally apathetic and disinclined to do the work at all


* <i>Perceptions</i> differed on progress days and setbacks days as well. On progress days, people perceived more positive
challenges in their work, and saw their teams as more mutually supportive and reported more positive interactions between 
the teams and their supervisors. On setback days, participants perceived both their teams and their supervisors as less
supportive.
  * (Note that these are just correlations, and do not prove causality); it likely goes both ways.
  * We're not sure if the inner work life changes are a result of progress and setbacks, or the other way around.


* We do know that more positive perceptions, a sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, happiness, and even elation
followed progress. Likewise, deteriorating perceptions, frustration, and sadness followed setbacks.


* <b>Wins do not have to be large to make a difference; many of the progress events the research participants reported
represented only minor steps forward, yet they often evoked outsize positive reactions.</b> 
  * Across all types of events the participants reported, a notable proportion (28%) of incidents that had a minor impact
  on the project had a major impact on people's feelings about it.


* Progress events that often go unnoticed are critical to the overall performance of organizations because inner work
life has such a potent effect on creativity and productivity, and because small and consistent steps forward by many people
can accumulate into excellent execution.
* The flip side of this is that small losses or setbacks can have an extremely negative effect on inner work life.
* <b>Negative events can have a more powerful impact than positive ones, so it is especially important for managers
to minimize daily hassles.</b>


* The work must be <i>meaningful</i> to you, otherwise it does not have the same impact.
* If tasks feel irrelevant, then even working hard to get things done can leave you feeling demotivated, devalued,
and frustrated.
* Managers can make sure that their employees know just how their work is contributing, and therefore why it is important.
  * <b>Work can be "stripped" of its meaning when:
  	1. employees' ideas are ignored, thus making that person feel like their contributions are not meaningful. 
    2. employees' sense of ownership in their work is destroyed by frequently and abruptly reassigning them to another project,
    and now they cannot see the other project through to the end.
    3. Managers send the message that the work employees are doing will never see the light of day
    4. Managers neglect to inform employees of unexpected changes in a customer's priorities.</b>


* Good managers act as a resource for employees; they do not <i>check up</i> like a micromanager, they <i>check 
  in</i> to see if they can offer help.


* The most important implication of the progress principle:
  * Managers who support people and their daily progress improve the inner work lives of their employees as well as 
    the organization's long-term performance.
  * The dark side: negative feedback loops. If managers fail to support progress and the people trying to make it, 
    inner work life suffers and so does performance. Degraded performance further undermines inner work life.


* Managers who show basic respect and consideration for employees can focus on supporting the work itself; they do 
  not need to worry about complicated incentive schemes or psychological manipulation to motivate employees.
* Effective managers set the positive feedback loop in motion. Focus on managing progress rather than the management 
  of people. 


* Managers who facilitate steady progress in meaningful work, make that progress salient to employees, and treat 
  employees well have the best chance of a high performance team. <b>Their superior work will contribute to 
  organizational success — and they will love their jobs.</b>
