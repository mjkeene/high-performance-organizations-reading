<h3>Rebounding from Career Setbacks</h3>
<i>by Mitchell Lee Marks, Philip Mirvis, and Ron Ashkenas</i>

`Key point: Take responsibility for your failures/shortcomings. Reframe losses as opportunities by learning from them.
Become excited about new possibilities rather than dwelling on negative emotions.`

<b>Note that this article affirms the recommendations in the book "Never Search Alone".</b>

* Even a dramatic career failure can become a springboard to success if you respond in the right way.
	* Determine why you lost
	* Identify new paths
	* Seize the right opportunity when it's within your reach


* People who were fired, laid off, or passed over for promotion often worked through the classic stages of loss: shock
and denial about the events, then anger at the company or boss, bargaining over their fate, and then a protracted period
of licking their wounds. <b>Many of them never make it to the "acceptance" stage.</b>


* High achievers usually take too much credit for their successes and assign too much external blame for their failures.
This protects self-esteem but also prevents learning and growth.
* People focus on situational factors or company politics instead of examining their own role in the problem.


* Most do not ask for candid feedback; they turn to sympathetic friends, family, or colleagues, who reinforce their self-image (e.g., "you deserved that job/promotion"; "you have every right to be angry") and feed their sense of injustice. <b>This prevents them from considering their own culpability and breaking free of the destructive behavior that derailed them in the first place.</b>


* Those who rebound from career setbacks take a very different approach. They actively explore how they contributed to
what went wrong, whether they judged a situation appropriately and reacted appropriately, and <b>consider what they
would do differently if given the chance.</b>
	* They also gather feedback from a variety of people (supervisors, peers, subordinates) -- this makes it clear 
      that they want <i>honest feedback</i>, and not consolation.


<u>Identifying New Paths</u>
* Turn your loss into a win; reframing losses as opportunities involves hard thinking about who you are and what you want.
* Escapism is a common reaction to career derailment -- people take trips, immerse themselves in busywork, drink or eat
excessively, or avoid discussing their thoughts and plans with family and friends. These activities give you space, but
rarely lead to a productive transition. 
	* It's more effective to engage in a focused exploration of all the options available.


* The status-quo has been disrupted, and it's not clear what success will look like in the future -- you're in a
"twilight zone". Pausing a bit can allow you to find new meaning in your setback.


<b>Note that this is very similar to what the book "Never Search Alone" recommends doing</b>
* Speaking to others to gain their perspective and advice on your goals can be very useful. One person mentioned
developed "four themes for my next job". She then tailored her job search to achieve those goals.


* Remember that you still have your skills and experience from your last job, they were not left behind. You also bring
with you the lessons learned from the setback. <b>You may also have productively revised your definition of success.</b>
	* Research has shown that needs and priorities can change dramatically over time -- major life milestones (e.g.,
  moving out for the first time, divorce, death in the family, etc.) are common examples of this happening.


* All of the people mentioned who turned their failure into a success did serious discovery work after the setback --
<i>and then acted with conviction</i>. 
* Note that it is possible to stay with a current employer and drastically change your mind-set or psychological
commitment. Shifting perspective like this takes just as much energy as switching companies or jobs.


* Resilience and adaptability don't come easily or naturally to everyone; the approach laid out here can help transform
the anger and self-doubt associated with failure into excitement about new possibilities.
